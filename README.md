<b>The Purpose:</b>

The goal of the history flashcards quiz is to give users an easy-to-use, entertaining, and instructive way to test and enhance their understanding of historical events and facts. The app
questions assumptions or facts that are only partially remembered, which promotes attention to detail and encourages knowledge without making it seem excessive.

<li>Quick quizzes are made possible by the True or False format.</li>
<li>Users of every age find it interesting due to its simple interface.</li>

<br>

<b>The design of the app:</b>

The app is easy to navigate as the buttons and the textviews are spaced out and aligned correctly, the appropriate size and color for the texts was used to prevent not being able to read the questions or texts properly. The UI is very creative and fun as the background is history related, which makes the app more interesting and fun to use. 

There are big buttons and a colorful background image, the app is designed in a way that can grab the attention of any one because of the vibrant background image that is used, some buttons are placed horizontally which makes it easuer to navigate the buttons and Linear Layout was used and this layout provides a clear and neat format.
